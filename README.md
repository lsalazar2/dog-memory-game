The fun game application generates 12 images and requests the user to click on an image. Once clicked, the images are moved around in a random order where the user must continue to click on unique images. Once the user clicks on a previously clicked image, the game is over with the high score shown as the number of successful clicks. The game is then reset with their score reset to 0, and showing the current previous high score so the user can try again and play a new game.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Random dog picture memory game using React the front-end with UI components, manages the dog picture images click state, and responds to user requests, Node.js, react-strap, annimate.css.
